Essays
------

You'll write and revise four essays in addition to several short non-revised homework assignments. Each student will also make one oral presentation. Readings will serve to get you thinking and provide models of good writing; they'll provide inspiration for your essays and discussion points for Essay 2. Here are the major writing assignments for the course.

### Essay 1 ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/essay_1))

It will grow out of your own memories connected with food. Essay 1 gives you practice in developing ideas based on your own experience and heightening your awareness of the audience(s) you write for.

**This essay will be revised once and polished for the portfolio.**

### Essay 2 ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/essay_2))

It will ask you to analyze and reflect on ideas from _In_ _Defense of Food_ and at least one additional reading, developing your own idea as you do so. Essay 2 gives you practice developing an argument and working with other writers' ideas. Please follow the directions for the proposal for Essay 2 ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/prop_fr_essay_2)).

**This essay will be revised once or twice, as needed, and polished for the portfolio.**

### Essay 3 ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/essay_3))

This is a research essay focusing on a topic of your choice from a list I will provide. It gives you the opportunity to develop your investigative and critical skills and your ability to organize a longer essay, along with practice using sources responsibly.

**This essay will be revised once or twice, as needed, and polished for the portfolio.**

### Essay 4 ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/essay_4))

It will be either a final reflection or a manifesto. Please complete the cover sheet for the revision of Essay 4 ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/cov_sht_rev_esy_4)).

**This essay will be revised once for the portfolio.**

**Note**: To pass this class you must hand in ≥ 20 pages of revised writing, distributed across your four essays.

Portfolios
----------

At our last class meeting I'll collect a portfolio ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/portfolios)) of all your written work for our class—so don't throw any of your drafts or homework away!

Oral Presentations
------------------

Oral presentations are a required part of all CI courses. In this class everyone will either give a 10-minute presentation on a food-related topic, or participate in a debate on the thesis of _In Defense of Food_.

Vocabulary Lists
----------------

I am asking you to keep a list of words that are new to you culled from our readings. You **may** include words that describe unfamiliar foods, kinds of hogs, etc.; but the most **useful** words to look up and learn are those that describe actions, moods, attitudes, characteristics of people-words you are likely to encounter again. Please follow the guidelines for the vocabulary list as described in this document ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/vocab_assignmt)).

Class Participation
-------------------

Please note that class discussions are part of the oral work of a communications-intensive class. All students are expected to participate in class discussions. Discussion should demonstrate not just familiarity with assigned readings, but also critical thought.
